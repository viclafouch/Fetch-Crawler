# Fetch Crawler [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler)

###### [API](https://github.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler/blob/master/docs/API.md) | [Examples](https://github.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler/tree/master/examples) | [Changelog](https://github.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md)

Distributed crawler powered by Fetch Crawler in Node JS.

## Features

Fetch Crawler is designed to provide a basic, flexible and robust API for crawling websites.

The crawler provides [simple APIs](#api-reference) to crawl these static websites with the following features:

* Distributed crawling
* Configure parallel, retry, max requests, time between requests (to avoid being blocked by the website) ...
* Support both [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithm
* Stop after a maximum amount of of requests have been executed
* Insert [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) automatically for scraping
* [__Promise]__ support

You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/viclafouch/Fetch-Crawler/blob/master/docs/API.md).

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
# npm i @viclafouch/fetch-crawler
```

> **Note**: Fetch Crawler does not contain [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). It's using the [fetch-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) module.

### Usage

```js
const FetchCrawler = require('@viclafouch/fetch-crawler')

// I use Cheerio to get the content of the page
// See https://cheerio.js.org
const collectContent = $ =>
  $('body')
    .find('h1')
    .text()
    .trim()

// After getting content of the page, do what you want :)
// Accept async function
const doSomethingWith = (content, url) => console.log(`Here the title '${content}' from ${url}`)

// Here I start my crawler
// You can await for it if you want
FetchCrawler.launch({
  url: 'https://github.com',
  evaluatePage: $ => collectContent($),
  onSuccess: ({ result, url }) => doSomethingWith(result, url),
  onError: ({ error, url }) => console.log('Whouaa something wrong happened :('),
  maxRequest: 20
})
```


## FAQ

### How is this different from Puppeteer?

This crawler is built on top of [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch).

[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) is a project from the Google Chrome team which enables us to control a Chrome (or any other Chrome DevTools Protocol based browser) and execute common actions, much like in a real browser. Fetch Crawler is a static crawler based on simple requests to HTML files. So it will be difficult to scrap the contents when the HTML dynamically changes on browsers.
